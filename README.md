## Title: Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data Using Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression



### 1. Introduction

Briefly describe the objective of the project, which includes:

Exploring feature engineering techniques.

Implementing Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models.

Evaluating the performance of each model on the Sentiment140 dataset.



### 2. Data Preprocessing

#### Dataset Description: 

Briefly describe the Sentiment140 dataset, mentioning:

Number of samples.

Features used (e.g., tweet text and sentiment label).

#### Preprocessing Steps: 

List and explain the preprocessing steps, including:

Removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, tokenizing, stemming/lemmatization.

Splitting data into training and testing sets.

#### Visualization: 

Include histograms or pie charts showing the class distribution for sentiment labels (negative, neutral, positive).



## 3. Feature Engineering

#### Overview of Feature Sets: 

Described the feature sets:

#### Bag of Words (BoW) using CountVectorizer:

Explained this feature set and why it was chosen.

#### TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): 

Described the TF-IDF approach and why it might improve classification.

#### Visualizations: 

Use word clouds or bar charts to visualize the top words by frequency for each feature set, which can illustrate the differences between BoW and TF-IDF.



## 4. Model Implementation

### Models: 

Provided a short explanation of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, mentioning:

Why these models are suitable for text classification tasks.

The assumptions of Naive Bayes (independence of features) and the logistic approach to binary classification.

#### Hyperparameters: 

Mention any key parameters used in the models (e.g., maximum features in vectorizers).



## 5. Evaluation Metrics
Metrics Used: Describe the performance metrics, including:
Accuracy: Overall correct predictions.
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: For Positive and Negative classes.
Confusion Matrix: To show the breakdown of true vs. predicted labels.
6. Results and Analysis
Model Results: Present the results from Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression in a summary table, similar to the one created in your code.
Discuss the metrics for both models and each feature set (BoW and TF-IDF).
Comparison:
Discuss which model performed better overall and why that might be.
Highlight how feature sets impacted the modelâ€™s performance.
Visualizations:
Include confusion matrices for both models and feature sets to visualize where each model misclassifies.
Plot accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in bar charts or grouped bar plots for a quick comparison.
7. Conclusion
Summary of Findings: Summarize your key findings, such as:
Which model and feature set performed best.
Observations on the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
Future Work: Suggest any potential improvements or next steps, like trying different feature engineering techniques, using more advanced models (e.g., SVM or deep learning), or tuning hyperparameters.
